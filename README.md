# random-quote-machine

This is my submission for the [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine), Random Quote Machine.

This project utilizes [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and AJAX to fetch quotes (in JSON) from a [freeCodeCamp database](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json). Styling is done using [Sass (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/) language extension. In addition, a tweet and tumblr button are included to share the quotes in a pre-populated format (complete with hashtags) for quick and efficient sharing.
